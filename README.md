# Minimum Spanning Tree:

MST is a program aimed at genreating a randomly connected, undirected, weighted graph, using both an adjacency matrix and adjacency list implementation. Then finding the minimum spanning tree within the graph.
This project is split up into four different parts:
-   Graph Generation
-   Edge Sorting
-   Kruskal's Algorithm
-   To be determined

Included are expected outputs of what the program should genereate.

### Graph Generation:

The graph is implemented in the Maze.java class which returns a a connected graph of "n" vertices, where "n" is specified in the input file. 

To determine if two vertices should be connected by an edge, a random number is generated and if that number is less than or equal to the "p" value specified by input,  then those two edges are connected with weight "w" which is a random number between 1 and "n" generated by two times the seed value.

To ensure the generated graph is connected, a depth-first traversal is used to count the number of vertices visited.
if the count does not equal the number of vertices specified by the "n" value the procedure restarts.

The graph generation is timed and outputted. 

###  Sorting Edges:

Sorting edges is done using three differing algorithms, Insertion Sort, Counting Sort, and QuickSort. 
To sort the edges, the adjacency list and matrix must first be converted into a list of edges which is done throught the getList and getMatrix methods in the Maze.java file. 
The edge class implements the Comparable interface so that if the sort being used is unstable, such as Quicksort, then the program can force the sort to be stable.
To determine which edge has greater priority first the weights are looked at if there is no deciding factor there, then the row numbers from the adjacency matrix are used, and if they are in the same row the column number is used to break the tie.  

The conversion from adjacency list and matrix to a list of edges as well as the accompanied sorting of that list are timed and outputted. Note that graph generation is not factored into the timing.

### Krushkal's Algorithm:
### Not yet implemented!
Implementation of Krushkal's algorithm with path compression and union-by-rank, using insertion sort, count sort, and quicksort to sort the edges of the graph, where the graph is implemented as both an adjacency matrix and adjancency list.
After the edges are sorted, and assuming no cycles are formed, choose an edge with the smallest weight from the list of the sorted edges, remove it from the list and add it to the minimum spanning tree.
Repeat this procedure until "n" minus one edges have been added to the MST. Then check that no cycles have been formed using the union-find algorithm with path compression.

The converting the adjacency matrix and adjacency list into an array of edges, as well as cycle-checking, and the actual construction of the minimum spanning tree are timed and outputted.
